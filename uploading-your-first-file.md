# Uploading your first file

{% hint style="warning" %}
The max number of files changes depending on the premium plan you choose. For information on that, go to our [Plans and Pricing](https://twayobiz.com/plans-pricing) page.
{% endhint %}

Hello and welcome to Twayobiz. To upload your first file click the “Upload file” button in the top right-hand corner.

Next, you will be taken to a page where you can upload your files. The title field must be a unique value as it will be used at the end of the sharing URL. I hope this helps and bye for now.
